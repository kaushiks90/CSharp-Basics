        //C# primitives are also called value types and predefined in the .NET framework.
        //Primitive types can be assigned a value directly. The value assigned is stored on the stack as opposed to the heap.
        //bool,byte,short,int,long,float,double,decimal,char,Structs

        //Non Primitive types
        //Non-primitive are also called reference types meaning the identifier has a reference to a location in memory which stores the variable.
        //The reason for this is all non-primitive types are derived from the object class and not predefined in C#
